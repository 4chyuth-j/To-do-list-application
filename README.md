## ðŸ“– How It Works

* The app maintains a list of tasks using React's `useState` hook.
* Users can add tasks via an input field.
* Each task can be:

  * Marked as done with a checkbox.
  * Deleted using a delete button.
  * Moved up or down in the list to change the order.
* State updates are handled with Reactâ€™s event system and array methods.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

* Add task persistence using localStorage or a backend.
* Implement user authentication.
* Add categories or priorities for tasks.
* Improve styling with frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
